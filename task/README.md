    - `gvnreddy`
    - `swamy`
    - `srinivas`
    - `vamsi`

2.  **Add Your Files**: Copy your Snowflake SQL files or other task-related documents into your specific folder.

3.  **Commit and Push**:
    - Stage your changes: `git add .`
    - Commit with a message: `git commit -m "Upload task for [Your Name]"`
    - Push to the repository: `git push`

## Rules
